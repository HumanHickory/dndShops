                    An organization dedicated to bringing magic users together, and empowering them in ways that are unachievable by ones self. Although all magic users are welcome, certain magic users, such as Paladins and Arcane Trickers
                    may find it challenging to move up through the ranks. However, for those such as wizards, warlocks, druids, sorcerers, and bards, the Academy is a wonderous place to put your current skills to the test, and learn something new in the process.
