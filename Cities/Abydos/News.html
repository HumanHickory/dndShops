                   For generations, we have harvested the red glass from the Valley of the Gods, a valley found South East of Abydos within the Abydanisian Desert.
                   The red glass, named after it's redish hue, is hard as stone, and is created when lightning strikes the red sands of the desert. 
                   As we all are aware, lighting storms are frequent in the valley. 
                </p>
                <p>The exceptionally hard and unique glass is in high demand for the people of Silver Rose. The trade brings money and high quality imports to Abydos,
                    benefiting our people greatly. However, harvesting the glass is quite challenging, as miners must assume the risk of a lightning strike.

                  On the night of the new moon, Natlypsis will be taken to the City of Spiders. She was caught one moon ago stealing goods from the Bazaar, a crime punishabled 
                  only by Repenting. To honor our history and to repent for our deviation from the old ways, we will sell Natlypsis and any other wrong-doers to the Spider Queen
                  in the City of Spiders.
