                    The Pact of Five, or Mayleichar, is in charge of running Abydos. Each Mayleichar is chosen from birth carefully. They must meet certain criteria in order to be considered.
                    First, they must be Tiefling. Second, they must be male. Third, they must be born on the same day the previous Mayleichar parished. Only then can they be choosen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a son has been choosen, they are raised by warlocks, trained in the magical arts, and taught the history of the fiend their predecessor once served.
                    On their 8th birthday, they are to make a pact with that demon, and serve them until the end of their days. Only in very few circumstances will the new 
                    Mayleichar make a pact with a different demon than their predecessor.
                </p>
                <p> Currently, Zorlyre is the head of the Pact of Five. </p>
                <p> Although women are never choosen to be in the Pact of Five, a Tiefling woman may become the wife to a Mayleichar. Although customarily Abydanisians only taken
                    one wife, Mayleichar are encouraged to take up to 5. 
                    The wives of the Mayleichar are tasked to make more trivial decisions that keep the city running, such as imports and exports, taxation, and purification of water. 
                </p>
                <p class="firstLetter">Tieflings are all encouraged to make pacts of their own, and are required to pledge themselves to one of the Mayleichar by the time they are 8 years old. 
                    All Tiefling who visit Abydos are required to pledge themselves to a member of the Pact by the end of the the first lunar cycle of their visit, or will be put on trial.
                    All non-Tieflings who visit Abydos are not permitted to stay an entire lunar cycle.
