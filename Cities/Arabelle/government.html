                Sir Ramsley Narrowbush, is the creme de la creme. The truest gentleman of them all. When the Anti-Magic laws were introduced, his forefather was the only one to 
                volunteer to manage the extermination of magic in Arabelle, perhaps one of the most taxing jobs of all time. Now, generations later, Sir Ramsley has taken it upon
                himself to not only clear Arabelle of magic, but continue his work through the entire continent. With the Church of the Herald backing him, it is
                unclear why he has not been made king of Arabelle, rather than simply an elected official.       
            </p>
            <p> During his time in office, Sir Ramsley has cultivated an atmosphere of zero tolerance towards magical practices and has pulled Arabelle out of its dark ways,
                into the light. Now, it is true that the economy has taken a turn for the worst, but we project this is temporary as all magical sales, including gimicks or anything
                promoting magic have been entirely outlawed.

                <img src="CityImg/CultOfTheHeraldEmblem.png" style="float: left; height: 20vh">
                The Church of the Herald was founded with one belief: There is but one god and he is eternal and despises magic. God created the universe as a whole and gave
                creatures life and happiness. 
            </p>
            <p> But these creatures were selfish and never satisfied. They became obessed with stealing the power of God and learned to channel power from the world he created.
                There selfishness and powerlust ripped the universe into pieces, creating the fractured planes of existence. The creatures fancied themselves gods, themselves, and 
                ruled over these planes, as if they had not betrayed their loving father.
            </p>
            <p>
                The universe must be returned to what it once was, or we will continue to be plagued by selfishness and ultimately lead to our own destruction. These fake gods
                cannot be allowed to live and get away with what they have done.
            </p>
            <p>It is time, now, for the people of Avyngäard to make a stand and destroy the magic which fractured the universe!</p>

        <h4 class="quaternary-text ">Arcane Academy</h4>
        <p>
            The Arcane Academy is an ancient organization dedicated to the teaching of magic to all races and magic wielders. We once had guild chapters all through Avyngäard,
            but since the Anti-Magic laws were put into effect, we were forced to pull back and operate out of Arabelle alone. 
        </p>
        <p> The Arcane Academy is currently presided over by Uhmera, the Elven Sorceress, and her Counsel. Uhmera has been Supreme since before the laws were put into effect
            and inists that within the walls and barrier of Arabelle, we continue to teach and practice magic as we did in the old days.

        <p>
            It is truly terrifying how many followers the cult has already collected, and what they will do with their power if it continues to grow.
