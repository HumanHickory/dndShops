            <h4 class="secondary-text">Sonridge Tremors</h4>
            <p>
                Severe earthquakes have been radiating from Sonridge. Officials report that they have ceased
                mining and the Tremors
                are still occuring. Experts from the Church of the Herald suspect that magic users in
                Undrek'Thoz, the Drow City, may be behind it,
                but leadership in Sonridge say this is unlikely, because the tremors are also affecting
                their city.
            </p>
            <p>
                It seems these earthquakes are being formed well below the city, deep in the Underdark. No
                one has dared venture so deep, but if
                the miners of Sonridge do not discover the source of these tremors soon, it could be the end
                of live as we know it on the eastern side of the continent.

            <h4 class="quaternary-text">Church of the Herald Recruiting Now!</h4>
            <p>
                The Church of the Herald, gaining unexpected popularity throughout Avyngäard, has decided to
                increase its numbers and open a second location
                in Silver Rose, which is on the western side of Avyngäard and further north than Arabelle.
                The placement will make enforcing anti-magic laws
                simplier and quicker.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before joining, we recommend taking a look at what the Church stands for, and what their
                mission is.
                Most law abiding and logical people, who understand how dangerous magic is, will fully agree
                with the Church.

            <p>
                Severe earthquakes have been radiating from Sonridge. Officials report that they have ceased
                mining and the Tremors are still occuring.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are unaware of what is causing these tremors, but it is cause for alarm. There have been
                multiple reports across the
                continent that suggest an unknown Elemental Force is causing havoc. Witnesses in Arynsport
                have reported that tidal waves
                have been plaguing the city, and our friends in Frostfire have said that an unusual amount
                of strong blizzards have been
                occuring.

            <h4 class="tertiary-text">Cult of the Herald Recruiting Now</h4>
            <p>
                The Cult of the Herald is planning on opening another branch in Silver Rose, although we are
                told that Silver Rose
                is as against this plan as we are. The cult is dedicated to wiping out magic users and will
                stop at nothing to complete their mission.
            </p>
            <p>
                More alarming, there have been reports a secret society within the cult itself, only
                available to certain members. We have been unable to
                infiltrate this society as of now. The society calls itself The Exterminators, and boast a
                rats head as their sigil. They are the most brutal
                of the Cult's members and have been known to mutilate their victims without question or
                inquery. Several of their victims have been non-magic
                users, but simple magicians and entertainers. It is wise to avoid using any form of magic
                outside the barrier.

            <h4 class="quaternary-text">Arynsport Heroes</h4>
            <p>
                Recently, a group of heroes were able to stop the tidal waves plaguing Arynsport. As
                Sonridge is also experiencing unsual elemental behavior,
                we believe it is prudent that we discuss with these heroes what they saw and how they
                stopped it.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is reported the heroes are, as far as we known, the following: Savven, a Tiefling;
                Bindar, a Red Dragonborn; Calypso, a water genasi elf; and Dax, a
                Satyr. It is unknown which possess magical talents and which do not.
            </p>
            <p>If anyone is able to find these adventurers, last seen in Swallows Song, please bring them to
                us right away. A reward will be given to anyone
                who brings them into the Arcane Academy, as well as for the adventures for complying.

            <p>
                The Carnaval Du Mystique is coming to Caster Hills! This circus, who only makes an
                appearance once a decade, is filled with magic from Feywild.
                Come see magic like you've never seen it before, performed by exotic magic wielders in an
                fun and safe environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tickets will be on sale at the ticket booth for 5cp a ticket.
            </p>
            <p>You can expect the Carnaval in about a week. Please meet at the Arcane Academy on opening day
                if you'd like to travel there as part of a group. It
                should also be noted that those who do not know where the circus is, will not be able to
                find it, so it will be safe from the Cult of the Herald.
