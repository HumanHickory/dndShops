                   Three days ago, Arynsport Harbor was once again hit by a tidal wave, crushing ships and sending many of our men to a watery grave. Still unsure of exactly who is responsible
                    for this nightmare, it is undeniably magic users from the Oyster Islands or Last Harbor, looking to destroy our city decades after the war. However, their murderous actions show just
                    how lucky we are to live in a civil community, never having to worry if our neighbors will curse us for saying "Good Morning" incorrectly.

                <p class="firstLetter">
                    Several of Arynsports most popular eateries have reported patrons falling very ill. Since food doesn't normally make us sick, we here at the Admiral's Inquierer believe
                    that is the work of dark warlocks within the city, purposefully cursing our fish supply. It is the only reasonable explination. Why would they do that, you might ask? Because all magic users
                    share blood with the infamous Necromancer, and like her, magic users are simply out to cause chaos and destroy all life on Avyngöard. If anyone has any information on the location of these warlocks,
                    please come see us at the Admiral's Inquierer immediately. Helpful leads may lead to rewards.

                    Once again, our favorite Arynsport eatery, the Salty Parrot, has created a culinary masterpiece with their tropical fish tacos. Their fresh fish, sourced from a sustainable and ultra secret location, is battered
                    to perfection, wrapped in a flour wrap, and topped with a pineapple coconut drizzle. This masterpiece compliments their spicy fish tacos, crab tacos, white sauce fish tacos, and, of course, their Original Fish Tacos. 
                    Additionally, the owner of the Salty Parrot has assured us his fish supply has not been cursed, and that none of his customers have become sick. So come one come all, and try not one but TWO delicious fish tacos for only

                    Yesterday, the terrorist that has been cursing our children was apprehended. Many of you remember from our latest articles that our children have been experiencing more accidents than normal. Many
                    very balanced children find themselves slipping on the cobblestone, or falling off monkey bars. This is the work of 9 year old Mina Pearl, who has been causing algea to grow on surfaces frequently
                    visited by children. Whats worse, is her curses have extended to injuring adults, with 72 year old Ester Saltbottom, a woman already crippled with arthritis, slipped on Pearl's nefarious algea and broke her hip.
                    Saltbottom, victim to mind control, has advocated against the arrest of Pearl, babbling that, "Mina is an innocent little girl. She didn't cause the algea to grow, the city being flooded repeatedly caused that."
                    It is unknown if Saltbottom will survive for long, or if Pearl will finish the job she started. Authorities arrested Pearl after watching her pull a copper piece out of another child's ear. Pearl claims her father taught her that trick.
                    No word yet on where David Pearl is, but a warrant has been issued for his arrest.
