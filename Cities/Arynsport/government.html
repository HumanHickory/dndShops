                    Admiral Glover Smithe, The Master of Harbors, is an elected official, although the Admiral has never lost an election. Reigning over Arynsport for three decades, the people
                    of the city have called to make Admiral Smithe royalty, assuming the role of King, previously held by King Damande Silverwater. Although Admiral Smithe has no plans on assuming
                    the role, he has stated he will continue running for Master of Harbors for all foreseeable  elections.

                    Sailor Glover Smithe, was a decorated seafarer back in his day. By the age of 17, the young human claimed the title of Captain, and was given his own ship in the King’s Navy. 
                    By the time he was 20, he was taken from the sea and became the King’s Master of Harbors, originally being a role that meant “hand of the king”. 
                    However, after King Damande perished in the Wars of the 3 Seas, leaving no heir, The Admiral was promoted to temporary monarch. 
                    Admiral Smithe removed the monarchy from Arynsport and replaced it with a democracy, because he believes Arynsport deserves the most qualified governing body, not just one with royal blood.
