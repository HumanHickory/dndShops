    <div class="container my-5 text-center" id="history">
        <h2>Burterran</h3>
            <p>
                Burterran is a volcanic wasteland. Mt. Charir Darastix – The Shattered Mountain is said to have
                erupted 1000 years, devastating the once lush island and replacing it with molten rock and ash.
                Shemetasammur, The Red Annihilation, was said to be the cause. Even as a young dragon, he was so
                powerful, even the mountains dare not to disobey his commands.
            </p>
            <div id="extendedHistory">
                <p>
                    After he destroyed the island, humans attacked him and were almost successful at killing the
                    young dragon. Since then, he has despised humans and never has forgiven their actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He himself forged the Red Dragonborn, the primary residents of Burnterran, out of eggs carved
                    from the island’s obsidian. He has charged the dragonborn to serve him indefinitely, defend the
                    island at any cost, and to bring destruction to humans. He also has a distaste for other
                    dragonborns, and forbids red dragonborn from fornicating with dragonborns of any other color. If
                    a mixed-breed is born to a female dragonborn, the mother is typically raped by all willing
                    parties, dragonborn or not, until death (either by bleeding, starvation, being beaten, etc), and
                    her halfborn child is either eaten by the village, or thrown into the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dragonborn created a village on the island, also called Burnterran, to do just that. For a
                    millennium, they have defended the island from invaders, hostile or not, and have taught their
                    young to burn cities and villages to the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although less aggressive and hostile than their ancestors, modern Burnterrans still prefer to
                    stick to their island, and rarely give invaders a chance to negotiate or retreat. Shemetasmmur
                    has not been seen by any living dragonborn, and has slipped into legend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The island is also home to portals to the fire realm. These portals are well guarded by the red
                    Dragonborn, and are forbidden to all, without the expressed permission of the village leaders.
                    However, fire rats, fire bird, newts and salamanders frequently escape the portal and many can
                    be found living on the island. Intelligent creatures from the fire realm are only permitted
                    through the portal with the permission of the village leaders.

                    Criaxeriac is our current cheif after slitting the throat of his predescesor in front of the whole village.

                        <p>
                            A recent report from Choba states that our very own Calypso Tempeststrider, daughter of the
                            late Ivellios Tempeststrider,
                            has not only made a full recovery, but has been tasked by the Master of Harbors himself to
                            discover the cause of the
                            strange waves, and to put an end to it. The information is reported to have come from
                            Arynsport, from Calypso's aunt Leshanna.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As many of you recall, the brave warrrior had a brush with death years ago as a band of
                            Sahuagin's attacked her and her father's ship.
                            After that, she left her home to stay with her aunt, who provided a nurturing and
                            educational place for Calypso to rest and heal and continue
                            sharpening her mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, during her recovery, her father was lost at sea. It is said she spent some time
                            looking for him, but it is unclear what answers
                            she found. But of course, our young hero couldn't turn down an opportunity to save her
                            people, and joined the Master of Harbors mission
                            to protect the ocean from whatever this danger might be.

                        <p>
                            There have been several reports of an impossibly large shark patroling the waters. Larger
                            even than the Great White.
                        </p>

                            We have very little information on this creature, and to our knowledge, have yet to suffer
                            an attack from it. Please be mindful
                            of it when sailing, and send a parrot back with any information you may collect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please be advised that Sahuagin worship sharks and frequently keep them near. We cannot say
                            for certain if the Sahuagin are linked to
                            this underwater giant, but in event they are, it is even more imperative to avoid an
                            encounter.

                        <h3>Eba'du No'ra Taste Testing</h3>
                        <p> A new tavern, Su Ri'ri'su, has recently opened up and is hosting a taste testing for their
                            new Eba'du No'ra.
                            As we all know, Eba'du No'ra is made from the Eba'du plant, which resembles sugar cane, but
                            tastes a little more sour.
                            Eba'du No'ra is the fermented version of this plant, and is stronger than most liquors found
                            in our world.
                        </p>
                        <p>Su Ri'ri'su has recently begun fermenting and distilling their own Eba'du No'ra, comically
                            named Eba'dusu, and would like
                            volunteer taste testers to try out the new brew.</p>
                        <p><small>WARNING: improperly distilled Eba'du No'ra, referred to as Eba'du Sulu, may result in
                                permanent blindness and death.</small>
