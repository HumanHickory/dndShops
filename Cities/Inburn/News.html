                   The Hyenas have struck again destroying several homes and shops within the city. No one knows where these Hyenas have come from, but they seem more intelligent and purposeful than
                    standard beasts. The attacks started 3 moons ago and seem to occur once a week. The shop owner at Epic Flail noted during this attack that he saw a strange shadowy figure accompanying the
                    Hyenas.

                    King Thrixl has decided to raise tax by 3% to help fund the creation of a Monument in his own honor. The merciful Lizard King plans to make the statue entirely out of gold.
                    Some suggest this is an extremely bad idea as a giant golden statue may bring the unwanted attention of the Dragon Vydryvion. Since no one has seen the Shadow in 100 years,
                    the handsome king has decided to ignore this advice. Additionally, the King of Kings has beheaded those suggesting he not build this statue to ensure there is not mass hysteria
                    amongst his people.

                    It is our pleasure at Sonridge Weekly to announce the 400th annual Sonridge Winterfest Ball. As we all know, the Winterfest Ball is the place to be for,
                    not only residents of Sonridge, but anyone who is anyone in the world. This year, Head of State, Brandon Turner, decendent of the famous Barnabus Crinamorte,
                    will be hosting the Winterfest Ball at the newly renovated Crinamorte Castle. Safety Inspectors have guarenteed that the castle is safe and no longer haunted,
                    and party planners have emphatically said that the party will be clean and proper, as expected, despite the age and condition of the castle.

                    In the last few days, we have had over 9 people pass away from an unexpected illness. All 9 of the victims were either miners or family members of miners.
                    Symptoms began only hours before death, and completely immobilized each individual before taking their life.

                    Recently, a group of brave heroes entered the underdark to rescue to save a group of trapped miners. Although the rescue attempt was nearly in vain, they were able to save
