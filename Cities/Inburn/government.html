                    The Lizard King Thrixl is the noblest king there has ever been. Standing 8 feet tall, he towards over puny human kings and even most of his superior kind.
                    The magnificent King Thrixl is a generous king. He allows lesser species such as bullywogs and kobolds to live in his kingdom peacefully, and enjoys the occasional
                    druid of various species as well. Under his leadership, Inburn has prospered, severly decreasing reliance on other cities while increasing exports. Some would say
                    that this has made imported goods significantly more expensive and harder to find, but most don't have much to say for very long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    King Thrixl has also massively reduced the amount of crime in Inburn. With a zero tolerance policy, price gougers and crooks are executed immediately with no questions asked,
                    to ensure the safety of kind King Thrixl's people. For greater crimes, such as treason, King Thrixl will carry out the sentence himself. Watching him behead a criminal with a 
                    single swing of his axe is quite an experience, indeed! Even those who are beheaded are graced with this spectacle as the last thing they ever see.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    It is rumored that King Thrixl slayed the dragon Vydryvion when the mighty King was no more than a small prince. During this battle, the heroic king lost his eye and was left
                with a giant scar. He himself has stated that it was a small price to pay for killing the dragon and keeping his future people safe. 
                </p>
                <p>All hail the king!</p>
