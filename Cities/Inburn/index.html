                        Continuing to work on an antidote for the deadly poison contained in the elusive Gas Spore. After examining the spores, I believe a mixture of
                        medicinal herbs from Inburn may help to create an anti-toxin.

                        Getting the spores cost me quite a bit, so all I can offer is 1 amulet that contains a level 4 or lower spell of your choice.
                        One time use, but can be used by any one, including a non-magic user.

            <h1 class="col-12"> The Mire of Vydryvion </h1>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container my-3">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12 whiteBG">
                <p class="firstLetter">
                    Five hundred years ago, a black dragon named Vydryvion hatched into the acid pools deep within the swamp. His murderous instinct took over and he quickly destroyed the other eggs in his clutch.
                    Rotting food was left for the hatchling by his absent mother, but the dragon did not want the flesh of rotting swamp rats. No, he hungered for something fresh.
                </p>
                <p class="firstLetter">
                    Vydryvion quickly began to traverse the swamp, only a tiny dragon at this point. He knew he wouldn't be able to kill anything by himself; he was only a few days old. Soon, he found came across two men,
                    lost within the bog. Vydryvion's next meal was in his sights. At only a few days old, he did not want to risk his life fighting these men. Instead, the wyrmling snuck closer to the men and let out a small cry.
                    The men instantly saw the tiny dragon, and were intrigued by his presence. Not knowing too much about dragons, the men decided to capture the tiny beast and sell him for a fortune. But Vydryvion had a different
                    idea. 
                </p>
                <p class="firstLetter">
                    The men approached the dragon, who ran quickly out of reach of the men, but stopped and looked back. His demeaner suggested curiosity to the men, and they were sure they could catch him. 
                    Vydryvion lead the two men back to nest, which rested in a pool of acid. Not paying attention to where he was going nor the sulfurous smell of the acid, the first man stepped unsuspectingly into the dragons trap.
                    The acid began to cook and melt the man's flesh. The second man, angered but stupid, charged the tiny dragon. A stream of acid left the dragons tiny mouth, melting the clothing and skin of the second man. 
                    Vydryvion feasted on both that afternoon. 
                </p>
                <p class="firstLetter">
                    Shortly after, Mother Dragon returned to check on her eggs. She was enraged to find that most had been destroyed. Vydryvion, knowing full well that he destroyed the clutch, blamed it on the two men,
                    using their decaying bones as proof. Believing the hatchling, Mother Dragon took off to destroy all the human villages she knew of nearby. It has never been confirmed what happened to the dragon, 
                    but she never returned/
                </p>
                <p class="firstLetter">
                    Vydryvion grew up alone in the swamp and was not known for his mercy. On few occasions, he would allow a single adventurer to live, but it was only to spread word of Vydryvion's massive hoard to potentially
                    attract a mate. This had only occured on one or two occasions. It is unknown if Vydryvion still resides deep in the bog. It is ill advised to search for the evil beast and he has not shown himself in at least
                    100 years. All that is known is that anyone who has gone looking for the dragon in that time has never returned.
