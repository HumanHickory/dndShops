        <h2>Kamininari History</h3>
            <p><b>
                    Ten thousand years ago, before man walked the earth, dragons ruled land, sky and sea. Growing tired
                    of her rivlary with nearby dragons,
                    the blue dragon, Arzagnirik created a race of dragons to protect her land. These creatures looked
                    like dragons, but walked on two legs and were
                    much smaller than Arzagnirik. This new race of Dragonborn created the ancient city of Kamininari.
                </b></p>
            <div id="extendedHistory">
                <p><b>
                        The blue dragonborns have protected their city for thousands of years, even after the
                        disappearence of Arzagnirik. It is said other
                        blue dragons have taken her place, but none have remained for long. The blue dragonborn guard
                        Arzagnirik's hoard and keep it as their own,
                        destroying enemies who seek to take their birthright. They have not worshipped any dragon since
                        the disappearence of Arzagnirik, including
                        blue dragons.
                    </b></p>
                <p><b>
                        Over many generations, the dragonborn lost their ability to fly as children were born wingless.
                        It is incredibly rare to find
                        a dragonborn with wings now. However, Nezzarred, our leader, has gained the ability to grow
                        wings.

                    The chief of Kamininari, Nezzarred has lead us for 2 and a half decades. A powerful sorcerer,
                    Nezzarred charged into battle against
                    Shemetasammur's Red Dragonborn of Burterran when they attempted to invade Kamininari. During this
                    battle, powerful dragon wings erupted
                    from the back of Nezzarred, and he was able to take flight and rain lightning down on the unprepared
                    red dragonborn.

                    Vorthaded, who lead the attack on Kamininari,
                    was said to have never lost a battle before the invasion, and has not lost a battle since. Nezzarred
                    allowed Vorthaded to live, as well
                    as many of the men, due to Cerel's, wife of Vorthaded, unmatched diplomatic abilities.

                        <h3>Arrival of new Dragon</h3>
                        <p>
                            A Young Blue Dragon has been seen in the Valley of the Gods, no doubt looking for the hoard
                            of Arzagnirik.
                            If the young dragon does not leave the area on its own accord, we may need to put together a
                            party to
                            remove them from the area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It does not appear as if the blue dragon has made a permanent lair yet. We suspect it aims
                            to take over Arzagnirik's lair as well as her hoard.
                            If the young dragon does create its own lair, that will prove problematic.

                            The Tieflings of Abydos continue to send unsuspecting fortune seekers into the Valley of the
                            Gods to collect the red glass.
                            As far as we know, none have successfully left the valley, due to the increased lightnight
                            storms - a side effect
                            of the young blue dragon's presence.

                            tieflings who
                            williningly enter the valley, if you happen to be in the valley and find these victims,
                            please return them safely to the outskirts of the valley.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many have offered a reward for their safe return, if that provides any incentive.

                        <p> Karuban has reported missing. It is assumed he left with Z, the wandering jester who we saved from the Valley.
                            We know the two were spending some time together, and both seemed to have disappeared on the same day.
                        </p>
                        <p>Karuban is a young dragonborn, no more than 15, and an aspiring sorcerer. It is said his power surpass that of 
                            Nezzarred at his age. His ability to manipulate lighting is unparalled.

                        <p>It is unclear what Z wants with the boy, if he indeed did take him, but Z should be regarded as dangerous and nefarious
                            until proven otherwise.
