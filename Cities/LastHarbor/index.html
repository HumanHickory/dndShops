                 Before recorded time, our fey ancestors came from Feywild and travelled the once watery world of the material plane. Some of these elves evolved and 
                 were able to breath underwater. They created the wonderous city of Sylt. Thousands of years passed, and Eldath, The Green Goddess and Mother of the Waters 
                 had pulled islands up out of the ocean for the ancestors of the Seledhel.

        <p><b>
            Our ancestors, the Sylt, grew curious about the surface world. Many grew to prefer the surface world, and began constructing the great city of Enalalith.

                    Virreau is the patriarch of this village and has lived a long and beautiful life. 
                    He has ruled over Enalalith for as longer than but a few can remember. His lovely wife, whose name has been forgotten
                    as she is commonly refered to only as O'si, meaning mother, acts a mother to all Enalalith people, guiding them 
                    by providing advice and compassion. She passed away only 3 summers ago.
                    Together, Virreau and O'si have had several beautiful children. The children have all left the island to seek knowledge and adventure, 
                    except for Yrashiae, mother of Virfaren.
                    Yrashiae was the only child of Virreau's to have parished, having passed during child birth
            </p>
            <p> Virfaren, the only known grandchild of Virreau is half human, half elf. His father is never spoken of. He is a strong warrior, and perhaps the 
                sharpest mind of Enalalith.

                     <p>
                        It is rumored that Arynsport is sending yet another band of infant heroes to attack the city. These heroes 
                        have been told, as the rest have, that the magic users of Enalalith are the cause of the tital waves. 
                        Since Arynsport is unable to protect themselves, due to their infantile fear of magic, it seems these pathetic raids 
                        will continue to happen. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         Remember to be kind to these heroes. They have been given false information and do not know better. 
                     </p>

                    <h3>Sea Monster</h3>
                    <p>We have received word from Seledhel:</p>
                    <p>
                        There have been several reports of an impossibly large shark patroling the waters. Larger even than the Great White.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have very little information on this creature, and to our knowledge, have yet to suffer an attack from it. Please be mindful 
                        of it when sailing, and send a parrot back with any information you may collect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please be advised that Sahuagin worship sharks and frequently keep them near. We cannot say for certain if the Sahuagin are linked to
                        this underwater giant, but in event they are, it is even more imperative to avoid an encounter.

                    <h3>Saris is under guard</h3>             
                    <p> As we come to the waxing moon, Saris' behavior is becoming intolerable. For now, he has been quarentined to prevent further damage
                        to our city and to our people. Virreau will be holding a discussion at the Amphitheater to discuss Saris' future amongst us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As many of you know, Saris was once a great salior and ship captian. He lead many voyages and expeditions in his time. However, 
                        he journeyed too close to Helinae and his ship and crew was lost to the treacherous waters. 
                        He was lost for years. Our city held a funeral at sea for the captian and his crew. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After almost a decade of being missing, a small, makeshift boat appeared in the Harbor. Saris was live, but not well. He spoke of an 
                        island in the center of Helinae that only appeared with the moon. He spoke of wingless dragons, apes the size of houses, featherless giant birds, 
                        and other wild creatures. Now, at the waxing moon, Saris becomes crazed and afraid, creating chaos and destruction within our city.
