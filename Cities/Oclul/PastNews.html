                <p class="firstLetter">
                    It was a beautiful winter's day like any other. Brave men traveled into the Upperdark, as they did every day, to escape the brisk air and the
                    ever present undead threat, and bring home money to put food on the table for their grateful families. But this was not like any other day. The
                    unthinkable happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the miners were digging in caverns and tunnels that had been well fortified, an unexpected cave in occured, giving no warning, trapping 12 heros
                    underground. Experts say that due to the depth and width of the tunnels, it is impossible to get any contraptions down there that would be helpful in
                    removing the rubble. Although the miners likely have a weeks worth of rations between them, it is unlikely they can survive longer than that in the dark,
                    impossible to traverse underdark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Underdark experts are attempting to find alternative routes to perform the rescue, but so far have been unsuccessul. Drow traders have stated that they
                    are unaware of any other path that could be used to tunnel or connect to the cavern, but admit that they are not experts on the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's just been so hard," Sharine Wilfordshire, wife of one of the miners and mother to eight told us. "Without my husband, I have no idea how to feed my
                    family. I hope someone is able to bring him home to us before we starve too."

        <h3 class="my-2 gray"><u>Miner Recovery </u></h3>
        <h5><i>Marina Cabarra, Sonridge Weekly</i></h5>
        <p class="firstLetter">
            It is a tragic day here in Sonridge. Twelve miners were digging in the caverns and tunnels last week when an unexpected cave in occured. All twelve miners were
            trapped. Despite the immense effort by Crinamorte Mining Co., the miners could not be dug out. In an interview with the cave manager, Drelkrat, it was stated that,
            "We exhausted countless hours and all the men we could find to dig out the lost miners. However, many boulders were too large to move carefully. Even with the proper
            equipment, we could not move the boulders would risking another cave in. Although it is unfortunate to lose such brave men, I am confident each and every one of them
            would not risk the lives of their brothers to dig them out. After days of planning and executing, we were forced to give up." It did not appear that there was any other
            way in.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this story does have a silverlining. Kelgrim, a svirfneblin decendent, was recused by a team of adventurers. Without the promise of glory or pay, four individuals
            were said to have found another way into the mines. According to Kelgrim, all eleven of the other miners had already moved on by the time the beautiful woman in black got to him.
            After tending to his internal wounds, offering him food and water, and saving him from a vicious drider and ravaged panther, the unknown women and her three friends brought him back
            to the Crinamorte Mining Co. where he was immediately hospitalized. It is expected that he will make a full recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't know why I'm the only one who made it," Kelgrim stated, remorsefully. "There were a lot of great men down there, worth 100 other men. But the gods saw it fit to send
            the dark angel to save me when I was only inches away from death. I will always be greateful to her, whoever she is."
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the identify of the woman and her friends is unknown, Senator Sebastian Moolman encourage you to come forward with any information you may have so the City of Sonridge
            can properly thank these heros.

        <h3 class="my-2 gray"><u> Slowdown of Undead </u></h3>
        <h5><i>Raker Firestone, Coalition Digest</i></h5>
        <p class="firstLetter">
            Residents of Sonridge are no strangers to the unprecidented attacks of the undead. From zombies and skeletons, to wraiths and wights, we have seen
            and defeated all sorts. But for the last eight years, the waves of attacks have been relentless. Katarina Cel Tradat, a member of the Clerici Vitae of
            the Coalition Dedicated to the Eradication of the Undead, has previously stated, "the undead attacks must be Sonridge City's main priority. Finding a
            permanent solution with as few casualtites as possible is imperative, and the CDEU will stop at nothing to achieve this goal."
        </p>
        <p>
            And it looks like they've succeeded. A recent study shows an entire 98% in all undead activity, and a 100% drop in ethereal undead in the Sonridge region.
            Traders from other lands have reported similiar findings, allowing trade to resume as intented.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, no one seems quite sure in why this sudden drop occured. Alexandru Baciu, another member of the Clerici Vitae, offered this: "There is no logical
            explination as to the sudden inactivity from the undead. Perhaps whatever was motivating them has been eliminated, perhaps they achieved their goal, or perhaps
            they are plotting an even larger, more devastating attack against our people. Until we can guarentee the Undead threat is gone, the Coalition will continue
            to opperate as if the undead plan to return."

        <h3 class="my-2 gray"><u> Underdark Exports Up 20% </u></h3>
        <h5><i>Kalinar Dyrr, Sonridge Weekly</i></h5>
        <p class="firstLetter">
            Undrek'Thoz has a continued history of success. Their willingness to trade with surface dwellers as well as other Drow civilizations allows them to benefit
            from both worlds. And their success contributes to Sonridge's success. Sonridge's most lucrative exports include exotic mushrooms, drow poison, and drow silk.
            All of these are produced exclusively in Drow cities, and wouldn't be possible for us surface dwellers to obtain without the kindness of Undrek'Thoz's Matron Mother,
            Zeerith.
        </p>
        <p>
            This month alone, we have seen an increase in Underdark goods by 20%. It seems they are able to grow, maintain and harvest more fungi, weave more silk,
            and produce more poison than ever before. Although we are unsure about the methods they are using to increase productivity, their success means our success, as our
            exports profits sky rocket.

        <h3 class="my-2 gray"><u>Museum Progress Halted </u></h3>
        <h5><i>Marina Cabarra, Sonridge Weekly</i></h5>
        <p class="firstLetter">
            The Museum of Mystical Arts has been a family favorite for residents and visitors alike. Free admission allows even the poorest amongst us to
            have an educational day with their children. From terrifying relics, mummified corpses of ancient warlocks, and enchanted weapons, this museum is unlike
            anything else in the known world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eight moons ago, the Pact of the Mystics, owner and operator of the museum, announced a new wing, dedicated exclusively to necromancy, to help the common
            people understand the modern threat a little better. New relics, mummified corpses, skeletons, weapons utilized by the undead and more are said to fill the
            additional wing. Sources that wish to remain anonymous have even stated that wizards from the Pact of the Mystics may even perform Raise the Undead magic on
            secured skeletons to demonstrate how necromancy works.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, museum progress has been halted for the 3rd time. Once again, builders have completely forgot what they were building and how to build it. One builder,
            Marcus Mayburn, even forgot who he was and didn't recognize his wife nor children! Many critics of the guild are saying that this is a sign from the gods that
            a wing dedicated to necromancy should be condemned, however, members of the Pact of the Mystics are saying that memory loss is not a side effect from necromancy
            magic, and that the gods don't give a damn about a museum. Guild leaders of the Pact of the Mystics have said that they are unsure why builders continue to lose
            their memory, but will investigate thoroughly before resuming construction.
