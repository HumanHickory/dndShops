        <h2>Oclul</h3>
            <p>
                The city of Oclul was originally the home to a dry grassland people, but the heat of the sun over many centuries
                    converted the grassland into a wasteland, and then into a desert. However, the soft, loose sand is only a few inches thick before reaching a hard, moldable earth.
            </p>
            <div id="extendedHistory">
                <p>
                    Mahvo Grassfire was a brilliant traveling merchant whose frequently travelled from Sonridge, the Mining City, to Abydos, 
                    the Tiefling Village. One day, on his journey, his foot was swallowed by the sand. When he managed to pull his foot out, it was 
                    covered in egg shells and green goo. After some exhausting digging, Mahvo came across an abanoned clutch of thri-kreen eggs. 
                    Knowing the abandoned village of Oclul was close by, he transported all the eggs to the village and reburied them in the cracking domes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first clutch of eggs only produced about 6 thri-kreen. Mahvo immediately began providing the tiny insects with meat and well water, 
                    encouraging them to accept this as their home. Not knowing any differently, the baby insects accepted this as their life. Over time, their numbers 
                    began to multiple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although Mahvo will occasionally still trade with other civilizations himself, he much prefers to have others come to him, and trade within the 
                    city of Oclul. Many traders and merchants are excited to see the city, since the Thri-kreen are rarely seen elsewhere.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-7">
                <p>
                    A thri-kreen resemble a giant praying mantis, bipedal and standing 4.5–7 feet
                    high and weighing 100–375 pounds; a full-grown adult averages at 6 feet
                    and 200 pounds. They have exoskeletons over their entire bodies. They have six limbs protruding 
                    from their thorax: two for walking and four for use as arms, ending in four-fingered claw-like hands capable of tool- and weapon-use. 
                    Their insectoid heads have two black, multi-faceted compound eyes; two small antennae sprouting from the top; 
                    and a complex jaw structure with large sharp mandibles. It is extremely difficult to distinguish the males and females.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Thought to be extinct in Avyngaard, Oclul is the only place where Thri-Kreen are born and raised. It is incredibly rare for a Thri-Kreen
                    to leave Oclul.

                            The monks of the Desert Temple made a sweet beer. Most caskets have been lost for centuries. 
                            Will pay 300gp to whoever will bring back the recipe, plus free sweet beer for life. Come see me, Ambertail, at the Windy Hyena.
