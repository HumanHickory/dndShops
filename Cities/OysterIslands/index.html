        <h2>Il'a'busu - The Oyster Islands</h3>
        <p><b>Il'a'busu, otherwise known as The Oyster Islands in common tongue, are an island chain to the south west of Arynsport. 
            Each island is known for their uniqueness, despite being swimming distance apart, and were so named the Oyster Islands, because one never knew what rarity they would find from island to island. 
        </b></p>
        <p><b>
            It is said that the people of Il’a’busu once wondered the waters on magical ships made in Feywild. The elves became trapped on the material plane long before any land was created. They adapted to their environment, learning how to swim great lengths. Some were said to even learn how to breath underwater and made their homes in the coral reefs. For the rest, they traveled aimlessly over the ocean world for eons. The elves became discouraged and fought themselves. They pleaded with the gods. Eventually Eldath, The Green Goddess and Mother of the Waters, heard their cries. She raised small islands from the depth and bestowed on each of them celestial gifts such as food, ores, and animals. She asked for nothing in return except the people of the islands love the land they were given and treat it with respect. For thousands of years, the people of Il’a’busu have done just that. 
        </b></p>
        <p><b>
            The main island of On’a’hau, or Seaspray in common tongue, has deep black sands and a large village made from white stone, also called On’a’hau. It also has a large harbor, known as the Bay of Three in common tongue, or Tu’un. The harbor is filled with hundreds of ships. Some are small fishing boats, large fishing boats, and seafaring ships owned by natives to the islands. 
        </b></p>
        <p><b>
            Other islands include U’baru the island of pink sand and hills with rich ore deposits, specifically silver. Y’rinu’a which is covered with bluish-green grassy hills. The grass grows straight into water and extends in a circle around the island. The residents of Y’rinu’a typically wear grass woven clothing and weave the grass around wood to build their houses. E’he’he’hu’eh is a tall sand bank, constantly covered in ankle to knee deep water. The villagers have built huts that stand on tall stilts around the island. They grow a strange and very rare crop called Eba’du that stands straight up like bamboo and only grows in the water. On’na’ki’na does actually have oysters around it. On one side of the island, salt water oysters grow in a large garden. The area isn’t well guarded, except for one ship from On’a’hau. If polite and nature loving visitors wish to harvest an oyster or two, the residents will typically allow it. However, they will not allow the garden to be devastated simply for the greed of outsiders.

                     <p>
                         A recent report from Choba states that our very own Calypso Tempeststrider, daughter of the late Ivellios Tempeststrider, 
                         has not only made a full recovery, but has been tasked by the Master of Harbors himself to discover the cause of the 
                         strange waves, and to put an end to it. The information is reported to have come from Arynsport, from Calypso's aunt Leshanna.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         As many of you recall, the brave warrrior had a brush with death years ago as a band of Sahuagin's attacked her and her father's ship.
                         After that, she left her home to stay with her aunt, who provided a nurturing and educational place for Calypso to rest and heal and continue
                         sharpening her mind. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         However, during her recovery, her father was lost at sea. It is said she spent some time looking for him, but it is unclear what answers
                         she found. But of course, our young hero couldn't turn down an opportunity to save her people, and joined the Master of Harbors mission 
                         to protect the ocean from whatever this danger might be.

                    <p>
                        There have been several reports of an impossibly large shark patroling the waters. Larger even than the Great White.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have very little information on this creature, and to our knowledge, have yet to suffer an attack from it. Please be mindful 
                        of it when sailing, and send a parrot back with any information you may collect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please be advised that Sahuagin worship sharks and frequently keep them near. We cannot say for certain if the Sahuagin are linked to
                        this underwater giant, but in event they are, it is even more imperative to avoid an encounter.

                    <p> A new tavern, Su Ri'ri'su, has recently opened up and is hosting a taste testing for their new Eba'du No'ra. 
                        As we all know, Eba'du No'ra is made from the Eba'du plant, which resembles sugar cane, but tastes a little more sour.
                        Eba'du No'ra is the fermented version of this plant, and is stronger than most liquors found in our world.
                    </p>
                    <p>Su Ri'ri'su has recently begun fermenting and distilling their own Eba'du No'ra, comically named Eba'dusu, and would like 
                        volunteer taste testers to try out the new brew.</p>
                    <p><small>WARNING: improperly distilled Eba'du No'ra, referred to as Eba'du Sulu, may result in permanent blindness and death.</small>
