            The village amongst the hills of the silent plains, Home to the highestest population of gnomes in Avyngäard, all gnomes are welcome in our home. 
            Except Svirfneblin. Those guys are weird.

                 Our claim to fame is our amazingest Tinkerers Program. At a young age, all gnomes are able to apply to our Tinkerer Academy, known as the Zimzam 
                 Academy Of Clockwork. The children are taught all about clockwork, mathmatics, and more.

            Our most famousest graduate is none other than Zimzamkatan, who the school was renamed after. This world-renowned gnome has dozens of inventions that have changed 
            the world as we know it, such as torches that produce light without fire, trams to cross the Storm's Rage Mountains, and more.

                <p>
                    Zimzamkatan, now old even for a gnome, is the most famousest gnome in history. When he was young, he started life attending the Tinkerer Academy
                    and graduated with the highestest honors. He is known for his contributions to Avyngäard and his hand in helping the adventurers who stopped the necromancer.
                    He is even more famouser than Willum, the gnome who was able to stop the dead from destroying the continent. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Zimzam has been known to take on apprentices but the only one who has been able to hold a light to Zimzam is his current apprentice, Tifaphimila, who 
                is the only gnome to graduate with the same honors as Zimzam. We look forward to watching her take Zimzam's legacy when he moves on.

                     <p>
                         The public works project we've all been waiting for is finally approved. All clockwork lighting will now be installed on every street 
                         within the village, so the city will be illuminateder over night. 
                     <p>
                         The thought behind it is quite simple. Without the cover of darkness, crime will be significantlyer detered, making this project worth the 
                         funds it will take.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         How does it work? Simple. The river turns the ol' mill wheel and winds a giant clockwork device inside the mill. The clockwork device, called The Time 
                        Keeper will continue to wind until the sun goes down. At that point, we will release the energy stored within the Time Keeper, and it will unwind.
                        The energy from the Time Keeper will transfer through underground wires and provide energy to the lights, which glow.
                        </p>
                        <p> A future public work project will include bringing this clockwork business into every home in Rivvenastorp.</p>

                        Tifaphimila, otherwise known as Tifa, is Zimzam's apprentice as is a genius herself. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She has recently created a self playing piano. It functions the same as a clockwork music box, but on a much granderer scale. 
                        Although not world-changinger, it is an excellent first project for the young graduate.

                    <p> The worstest types of humanoids have striked again! Bugbears have been plaging Rivvenastorp for decades now, and for 
                        how stupid they are, we still haven't been able to find their lair. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Recently, they have broken down our defenses yet AGAIN, meaning they will need to be repaired for the seven billionest time. 
                        Zimzam already has a team on it, and it is expected to back up and running soon.    
                    </p>
                    <p> The mayor has offered a reward for anyone, Rivvenastorpian or not, who can bring these Bugbears in and tell us where they live 
                        so we can squash them like the BUGbears they are.
