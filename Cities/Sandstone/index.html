            kingdom at the foothills of the mountains,
            while our brothers in the north hide tucked away within it. Our fortress is carved from the lower mountain
            hills into glorious monuments for all to see,
            and our mine runs deeper into the earth than any other dwarven kingdom.

                King Gardain Fireforge son of Morgran is our Dwarven King of the Red Desert. He and his wife, Yilda, and their son Sorgrin
                work tirelessly to keep our fortress safe and thriving. Under his leadership, we have brokered a deal with the Spider Queen 
                and the Demon Warlocks of Abydos to ensure peace and prosperity for all.
            </p>
            <p>However, our generous and agreable king understands that demons and spiders cannot be trusted, so we have perfected the art of 
                war alongside the art of diplomacy.

                    <h3>Path to Vik’il’skra Closed</h3>
                     <p>The tunnel to Vik’il’skra, City of Spiders, has experienced a cave in. Although problematic, fixing this tunnel is not our first priority.
                        However, The Abydanisian Warlocks are still demanding we escort their criminals to the the Drow city, and we are certain the Spider Queen
                        is not taking the cave in very well, as it blocks her people off from the surface world. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         For this reason, we are choosing to continue to postphone reconstruction of the tunnel. Although diplomacy is important to us, we will not
                         bend to the needs and desires of other kingdoms who would treat us like the slaves they trade and sell.

                    <p>
                        The Lightning storms in the Valley of the Gods has been spreading. Friends in Kamininari believes there is a Blue Dragon living in the desert mountians,
                        and as he grows larger, unchallenged, his fearsome lightning storms will spread.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Kamininari are unaffected by the lightning but the dragon-king Nezzarred has offered the help of his men if we decide to search for the beast. 
                        We have not heard from the Warlock Counsel of Abydos if they are willing to join together to fight this evil. Queen Zilssaria, the Spider Queen, will 
                        not come to our aid.

                    <p>Many of you heard that Medendivestrall has acknowledged the great and powerful King Gardain as a righteous, just, and diplomatic king.
                        Seven suns ago, we sent five of our men into the desert to retrieve his gift to King Gardain. 
                    </p>
                    <p>However, none of these men have returned.</p>
                    <p>It is our belief that Anuchuit Tribesmen have captured and likely killed our clansmen. Although it is possible that the Abydanisians Tieflings
                        may have intercepted our men, it is unlike them to cause disagreements with our kingdom, unless provoked. King Gardain is setting up a search party 
                        to locate these men.
