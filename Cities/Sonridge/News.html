                <p class="firstLetter">
                    Yesterday, a man was found covered in blood in the streets. On his back, he was branded with a strange symbol: an eye with two crossed swords behind him.
                    On the ground, a single bronze coin with the head of a rat was found. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Could it be the undead? Very unlikely. Doesn't seem like zombie behavior. But you can never be too cautious!

                <h5><i>Annabelle Merryberry, Sonridge Weekly</i></h5>
                <p class="firstLetter">
                   It's no surprise that Sonridge has been experiencing some nasty tremors as of late. But what could be causing it. Tremor expert Filius Fry suggests
                   purple worms are behind it, an ancient species of giant worm thought to have carved out the entire underdark. Other self-proclaimed experts like 
                   Marilyn Marque have even crazier ideas of "tectonic plates", which are incredibly huge pieces of rock that 'float' on underground lava pools and move.
                   She hilariously believes that these occasionally bump into each other, creating seismic activity. What a kook!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's even more interesting is they're experiencing the same earthquakes in Undrek'thoz, the Drow settlement beneath Sonridge. No one has been
                    able to communicate with them on what they believe is happening.
