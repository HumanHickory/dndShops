                <p class="firstLetter">
                    Yesterday, covered in blood from head to toe, one man came stumbling through the coalition doors. Reportedly, this man had a brush with death... or rather un-death.
                    Could this be a hoax, or the beginning of the end?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sandu the Shepard, a member of the Clerici Vitae here at the coalition, speaks about the impending doom that could befall us all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The threat of the undead is very real. Despite my best efforts, and the help from mother nature, I was unable to save my own town of Willow's Watch. Everyone I once
                    knew is now dead due to undead. From what we can tell, a necromancer is creating and controlling these hoards. We have intel suggesting this person's whereabouts, but
                    will require more investigation before providing this information to lower level members and the public. Once we have successfully determined the location of this necromancer,
                    as well as formed a fool-proof plan to destroy them, we will begin mass recruiting warriors to help us save the world," Sandu explains.
                </p>

                <p class="firstLetter">
                    It is our pleasure at Sonridge Weekly to announce the 400th annual Sonridge Winterfest Ball. As we all know, the Winterfest Ball is the place to be for,
                    not only residents of Sonridge, but anyone who is anyone in the world. This year, Head of State, Brandon Turner, decendent of the famous Barnabus Crinamorte,
                    will be hosting the Winterfest Ball at the newly renovated Crinamorte Castle. Safety Inspectors have guarenteed that the castle is safe and no longer haunted,
                    and party planners have emphatically said that the party will be clean and proper, as expected, despite the age and condition of the castle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Entry into the Ball will cost 30gp per person, and all proceeds will go to various undead relief charities dedicated to helping victims of undead attacks.
                    Food prepared by world famous chefs will be provided, and drinks will be available for dontations. Formal attire is, as always, a requirement, and those not dressed
                    to standards will be asked to leave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The local fighter's guild, known as the Might of the Lost Age, have once again agreed to provide security at the event to help minimize unnecessary drama. It is
                    even rumored that Julius, Master of Blades, will be there in the flesh!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, families that have been especially affected by the undead have been invited, free of charge, to attend the ball and give speeches on their unfortunate
                    experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't miss this exciting time, and join us for the party of the century!

                <h5><i>Marina Cabarra, Sonridge Weekly</i></h5>
                <p class="firstLetter">
                    In the last few days, we have had over 9 people pass away from an unexpected illness. All 9 of the victims were either miners or family members of miners.
                    Symptoms began only hours before death, and completely immobilized each individual before taking their life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experts at the Academy of Mystic Arts all agree that this is not likely magic. Micardra Dinoryn, toxicologist and owner of Five Finger discount, suggests that
                    the later effects do mimic poison, but nothing that she has seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even more grim, the bodies began decaying quickly after death and began to grow fungus in various parts of the victim's body. Other miners, family members, and those that interacted
                    with the victims have began showing signs of sickness. Clerics are working non-stop to cure this disease, but without more information, are struggling to find a solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Liaisons to Undrek'Thoz are reporting that this mysterious illness has not infected the city of the Drow. However, if the infection continous to spread, Matron Mother,
                    Zeerith, has threatened to cease all trade until the problem is solved.

                    Recently, a group of brave heroes entered the underdark to rescue to save a group of trapped miners. Although the rescue attempt was nearly in vain, they were able to save
