            <p><b>Description:</b> Each round, players will compete to get as close to 21 points as possible. They do this by rolling a d6 as many times as they like, 
            and adding each new roll to their total score. However, if a player rolls a 1, their points for the round reset to 0. Players who get exactly 21 points will 
            win triple the pot (or split evenly if there is a tie). If no one gets 21 points, the player who is the closest (either over or under) 
            will win triple their bet.</p>

            <p><b>Description:</b> Players will guess either the exact number of a single d20 rolled by the dealer, and/or will guess whether the result would be odd or even.
            A player who has guessed the exact number wins triple the original amount they have staked, and anyone who guesses the odd or event outcome will get a 1.5 payout.
