                    Sonridge City's government is a collection of two Senates - the Senate of Sonridge and the House of the Magister - and a Head of State.
                </p>
                <h5> The Head of State </h5>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../img/portraits/Brandon turner.jpg" style="float: left; height: 20vh">
                    The current Head of State is Brandon Turner, son of Beldon and Kathleen Turner, and the decendent of Barnabus Crinamorte. At 17 years old, Brandon joined the Fighter's Guild and worked his way up to becoming
                    a General among their ranks. When the war began, Brandon quickly rallied to the call and lead several vanguards into battle. Each battle, he returned victorious. Due to his heroic efforts and unquestionable
                    loyalty to the City of Sonridge, he was elected Head of State by the people and confirmed by both Senates, unanimously.

                    <br><br>

                    Brandon Turner is unmarried with no children. He currently resides in Crinamorte Castle, and it is thought he is the heir to the Crinamorte fortune after the passing of his relative Bram Crinamorte and his daughter, Lucy,
                    as well as Bram's Brother, Bancroft Crinamorte, and family mysteriously disappearing.
                </p>

                <h5> The Senate of Sonridge</h5>
                <p>
                    The first and primary senate is responsible for the vast majority of decision making in Sonridge City. Each Senator is elected by the people of Sonridge, and will remain in position for 10 years. They may then
                    choose to run again, an unlimited number of times. Although there is no law specifically prohibiting it, there has never been a female senator, nor a senator of a race other than Human, Elf, and Dwarf. There are 12
                    Senators at any given time, and ties are broken by the Head of State.
                    <br><br>
                    Some of the primary responsiblities of the Senate are managing trade relationships, passing and enforcing laws, setting and collecting tax, approving new large buildings and guild halls, and more.
                </p>
                <p><b>Current Senators</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sebastian Moolman</li>
                    <li>Bemdath Deepchin (dwarf)</li>
                    <li>Tasar Genfaren (elf)</li>

                    <li>Rowan Underwood</li>
                    <li>Matias Demarco</li>
                </ul>
                <h5> The House of the Magister</h5>
                <p>
                    The House of the Magister is a specific Senate set up to deal with issues regarding magic and the treatment of magic users. There are six members of the House at any given time. Although they do not get to vote
                    on normal issues that are brought to the Senate, each vote is weighted as double on issues regarding magic. It is not a requirement to be a magic user or to have ties to the magical community to become a Magister.
                    In fact, there have been times when the entire House consisted of non-magic users.
                    <br><br>
                    Some of the primary responsiblities of the Magisters are to decide what magic is illegal inside the city, make decisions about how to handle criminals that are magic users, and to monitor guilds that are dedicated
                    to the use of magic.

                </p>

                <h5> The Election Process</h5>
                <p>
                    Both Senators and Magisters have 10 year terms. Elections are only held when one of these members comes to the end of their term, steps down, or passes away. It is also possible for a member to be dismissed
                    early, but a majority vote from both Senates must be met, as well as the agreement from the Head of State.
                    <br><br>
                    The Head of State servers for life, or until they step down. There is no process to remove a Head of State from office, which may account for the high number of homocides of those in the position.
                    <br><br>

                    The voting process is simple. Every citizen in Sonridge must register to vote 3 months in advance. Only those who are 16 and older may vote. At the time of registering, citizens may choose to provide their
                    financial documentation. Those with higher stakes may be given more votes.
