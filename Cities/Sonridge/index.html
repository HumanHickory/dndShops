                <p class="firstLetter">
                    Sonridge city originally started as a travellers town, providing food and shelter from a single inn and tavern, Sonridge Inn, for those traveling across the Silent Plains. Overtime, other merchants and traders began to settle
                    near the inn, providing season appropriate clothing and mount supplies to travelers, as well as fresh fish and wild game for the tavern. The single building rest stop soon grew into a full sized village.
                </p>
                <p class="firstLetter">
                    Then, something unexpected happened. A clan of hill dwarves, called Clan Duergar decided to move into Sonridge village. They said they were lead to the town with a strange desire to mine. Their visions paid off. Mass amounts of iron, adamantite
                    and gems were found under Sonridge village. This drew in miners and gold seekers from all over the world. Clan Duergar continued to dig deeper, promising that even more riches resided below, and eventually stumbled upon the Drow city,
                    Undrek'Thoz, under the rule of the Matron Mother, Zeerith. A deal was struck by the richer folk of Sonridge village, who were filling in as the government, and the Drow village. Sonridge was able to trade massive amounts of desireable overworld
                    goods, and the Drow would provide Underdark materials and protection. The deal still exists today.
                </p>
                <p class="firstLetter">
                    The wealth of the city continued to grow and the relationship between the Drow and overworlders flurished. Many Drow even took human wives, strengthening the bond between the two great cities. Clan Duergar continued to dig deeper into the
                    mountain, and has not been seen for centuries. A republic was set up to function as the government, and is ruled by two Senates and a Head of State. The current Head of State is Brandon Turner, decendent of Barnabus Crinamorte.
                </p>
                <p class="firstLetter">
                    As Sonridge began to rise from village to city, a young lad named Barnabus Crinamorte saw a future decorated with riches. Barnabus was able to transport goods from Sonridge all the way across the continent to Arynsport with a 98% success rate.
                    At the time, it was common for trade routes to be plundered or for shipments and traders to go missing in the Storm's Rage Mountains. Barnabus found a way to circumvent this issue, but no one could figure out how, and his crew was incredibly
                    loyal to him. Additionally, Barnabus could move products at nearly four times the speed of a normal shipment, getting goods from Sonridge to Arynsport in just 6 days, versus the normal 23 days. This made Sonridge not only a hub for mining, but
                    the central location for trade, as well. After making a fortune in Sonridge,  Barnabus moved to Arynsport, purchased half a dozen of the fastest ships, and continued his trade route overseas. Finding success in this new business, he grew old
                    near the ports of Arynsport. After decades of hard work, he finally moved back to Sonridge, where he married the young and beautiful Anabeth Rose, and had two sons, Celestine and Julius. Unfortunately, Barnabus passed away before Anabeth Rose
                    even knew she was pregnant with her second child, but his memory lived on through his son.
