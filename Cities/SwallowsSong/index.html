        <h2>Swallow's Song</h3>
            <p>
                Swallow's Song is a unique town on the western side of the Silent Plains. It is so far west that it is
                bordered by the Storm's Rage mountains. For thousands of years,
                Swallow's Song was the last city adventurers would visit before attempting to cross the mountains, as it
                is is at the bottom of the lowest ridge of the mountain range.
            </p>
            <div id="extendedHistory">
                <p>
                    The climate of the village is perfect for apples to grow. The villagers have been proud of their
                    orchards for a thousand years.
                    That is, until the undead came. After destroying major cities such as Silver Rose, the necromancer
                    and her undead army came to Swallow's Song, burning every
                    house and every apple tree, simply to climb the mountain to the Talos Temple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also said that the warriors who defeated the Necromancer first met in Swallow's Song. Although
                    Nosaj, Ellena, and Velhalla all parished, they were able to
                    bring together other adventures, such as the late Vincent and Balsimar, and the heros who were
                    finally able to stop the evil changeling, Willum, Zen, Nym and Faul.
                    It is said that Nym, the most powerful druid who ever lived, even visited Swallow's Song to try our
                    famous apple pie and said it was the best she had ever tasted in her life.

                <p>
                    Here is Swallow's Song, we have just about every type of apple you can think of. We have the more common Golden Delicious, Fuji,
                    Gala, Lady, McIntosh, Granny Smith, Honey Crisps and much more. We also have more exotic apples, such as the Black Diamond, the Pink Pearl,
                    and the Java Apple. 
                </p>
                    We spend 365 days a year tending to our apples and just about every villager has at least one apple tree, even if they're not a farmer. We turn 
                    these delicious fruit into even better baked goods and sell them to adventurers attempting to climb the Storm's Rage mountains. We like to give them
                    a little goodness in their life before they die.
                <p>
                    <p> Now, with the new lift system designed by gnome tinkerer Zimzamkatan, everyone can travel to Arynsport across the mountains. 
                        This has only helped grow our business, and we are now able to trade with Arysnport with ease.

                        <p>
                            CiderWorks is proud to announce the opening of it's new bakery AppleWorks. 
                            Formerly only brewing craft ciders, we all look forward to trying the 
                            baking abilities of Mr. And Mrs. Applesmith. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Mrs. Applesmith, originally from a baking family in Silver Rose, has years of experience
                           crafting delicious pies, cakes, and cookies. Mixed with the inspiring apples of the Applebottom farm, 
                           these baked goods cannot be missed!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mention the code "Twisty Apples" to get 25% off one baked good.

                        <h3>Pumpkins?!</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Whiteapple family is selling their orchard to buy new farmline to grow pumpkins. Yes, you read that right. Pumpkins.
                            What orange abomination is this? 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is still time. If you see a member of the Whiteapple family, please remind them how amazing their apples are and how
                            it just won't be the same eating Whiteapple's Apples without them being grown by the Whiteapple family. 
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please also keep in mind how this will impact the economy. If we begin selling Pumpkin Pies, tourists will be confused as to 
                            what we are known for. Even worse, some may support the pumpkin fields moreso than the orchards! This would be out of pity of course, not because
                            pumpkin products could ever be better than apple products.

                        <p> The strange vibrations you have been feeling are real. We have word from the east that the city of Sonridge
                            is experiencing unexplainable earthquakes. We believe that we can feel them due to the Crinamorte Mining Co.'s 
                            underground tunnel that connects Arynsport to Sonridge.
