	<h3>Amanda</h3>
	<p><b>Human</b> <span class="green">50gp/hr</span></p>
	<p>Amanda is the type of girl you want to play house with when you can't stand to be around your own wife. At only 18 years old, she doesn't have
	the confidence to nag your ear off yet. Settle down and have a relaxing night, and let Amanda take care of you.

	<h3>Sarah</h3>
	<p><b>Human</b> <span class="green">30gp/hr</span></p>
	<p>If Sarah had an idea, it would die of loneliness. Luckily, you're not here to hear our girls talk! Enjoy an evening being with a girl whose only sounds
	are the kind you make her have.

	<h3>Gemini</h3>
	<p><b>Human</b> <span class="green">100gp/hr</span></p>
	<p>Gemini comes from a long line of magic users, but wasn't strong enough to make the cut. What she lacks in magical talent, she certainly makes up for in the 
	bedroom. Using the weak amounts of magic she does possess, Gemini can give you that extra something you've been waiting for.

	<h3>Anya</h3>
	<p><b>Human</b> <span class="green">100gp/hr</span></p>
	<p> Held underground as a slave by drow for many years, Anya is used to serving and will acquiesce almost any requst. Let your inner dragon out while fulfilling even your 
		darkest desires.
	</p>

	<h3>Moonlight</h3>
	<p><b>Half Human, Half Elf</b> <span class="green">150gp/hr</span></p>
	<p> One of our more exotic girls, Moonlight came to us as at only 6 years old. Now, an incredibly young (half) elf of 25, Moonlight is here to make your exotic
	fantasies come true. 
	</p>

	<h3>Selyse</h3>
	<p><b>Elven Druid</b> <span class="green">500gp/hr</span></p>
	<p> Selyse is another one of our more exotic girls. Her fey ancestry makes us more unique than any other brothel in the universe. Selyse used to be a patron of Broken Flute,
	but traded her freedom for that of her lovers. Once free, her lover immediately left her here for your enjoyment!
